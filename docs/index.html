				<p class="hero-paragraph"><p>When you expose a public IP address on the internet, you inadvertently invite a barrage of automated bots and malicious actors, continuously probing and scanning for vulnerabilities. Our extensive testing has revealed an alarming truth - up to 8,500 unique probers target a single public IP address in a month.</p>

				<p>While many security professionals turn to vulnerability scanning and penetration testing as a reactive approach to address these risks, it's only the first step. To truly safeguard your network, it's essential to prevent unauthorized scanning and probing. By proactively implementing network counterintelligence.</p></p>

			    <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">
			    <p>As networks become more interconnected and diverse, the attack surface expands. With multiple publicly accessible assets and various entry and exit points, organizations face the challenge of securing a complex network infrastructure. The need to effectively manage and mitigate risks across the expanded attack surface is driving the demand for automated network security solutions.</p>

			    <p>With the continuous probing and reconnaissance scans conducted by malicious actors, there is a growing need to gather and leverage network counterintelligence. Organizations are recognizing the value of acquiring insights into adversaries' tactics, techniques, and IP addresses. Network counterintelligence helps in building stronger defense mechanisms, enabling proactive blocking of these bad actors.</p>

			    <p>The combination of advanced analytics and automation is becoming essential for effective network security. Organizations are leveraging analytics tools and solutions, Lure enables faster threat identification and automated decision-making to protect the network.</p>

			    <p>The adoption of threat intelligence platforms is on the rise. These platforms provide access to real-time threat intelligence feeds, aiding in the identification and prevention of potential cyber threats. Integration of threat intelligence platforms with existing security infrastructure enables organizations to enhance their defense capabilities.</p>

			    <p>The pressing need for advanced network security solutions that can address the increasing sophistication of adversaries, limit the attack surface, and leverage network counterintelligence. Is your organization investing in technologies and strategies that integrate analytics, automation, and threat intelligence to strengthen its security posture?</p>
